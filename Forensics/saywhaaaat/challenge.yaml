  An advanced persistent threat actor going by the name APT666 managed to set up a
  backdoor on one of our machines. We don''t understand exactly what happened, but
  we have retrieved a suspicious file and the network traffic from the time around
  the event. Please have a look!


  *Disclaimer: The malicious file will not harm your system as the "C2" server has
  been taken down, but always handle malware samples with care!*

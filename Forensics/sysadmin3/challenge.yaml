description: 'Our sysadmin came back, created a new web portal and ran off mumbling
  something about job security.

  We need to access his web site, but unfortunately only got a copy of the AppData
  folder this time.

  Can you please help us out?

  (This challenge can be solved without solving sysadmin1 and sysadmin2 and the files
  are different from the previous challenges so make sure you download the above file
  for this one.)'

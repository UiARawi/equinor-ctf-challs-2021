  You might have heard of buffer overflows, but do you know how to exploit them?


  The goal of this challenge is to overwrite `main`''s return pointer which is stored
  on the stack, with the address of the win() function. There are several good (and
  bad) tutorials on how to do this online. Googeling for example `ret2win` or `binary
  exploitation buffer overflow` might be a good place to start.


  My personal favorite is the [Binary Exploitation / Memory Corruption](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN)
  playlist by [LiveOverflow](https://twitter.com/LiveOverflow). [Buffer Overflows
  can Redirect Program Execution - bin 0x0D](https://youtu.be/8QzOC8HfOqU) goes in
  to detail on how to redirect redirect program execution, but it might be a good
  idea to watch the playlist from the start if you dont have previous knowledge on
  the  topic.

description: "Category: Pwn\n\nThe printf function in expects one or more parameters.\
  \ In the man page its defined as:\n`int printf(const char *format, ...);`\n\nIf\
  \ the first (and only) argument is a pointer string without any formating options\
  \ it just prints the string. But what happens if we only have one argument, that\
  \ is user controlled? \n\nThe [man](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html)\
  \ page can be a good place to start.\n\n\n`nc {{host}} {{port}}`"

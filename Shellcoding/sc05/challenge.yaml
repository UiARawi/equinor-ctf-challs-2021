description: "### Part five \n\nThis one is a bit different from the others.\nThe\
  \ flag is in one of 200 files that are randomly created in `/opt/flag/`. You need\
  \ to find and print the flag. The files are recreated every minute using the script\
  \ `generateFiles.py` which is attached. \n\nI've also disabled execv and fork syscalls\
  \ using seccomp. GL HF! :)\n\nYou need to install `libseccomp-dev` to compile, and\
  \ then run gcc with the lseccomp flag; `gcc -o sc05 sc05.c -lseccomp`\n\n`nc {{host}}\
  \ {{port}}`"
